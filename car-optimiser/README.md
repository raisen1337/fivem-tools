# Car Optimiser

A tool built to optimize textures of a vehicle.

# How to use?

If you use the .exe provided do the following:

- This works by extracting all ytd contents as png/jpg to a folder "input" which should be in the same folder as the tool, then opening the tool and selecting a optimising factor. The higher the better, but also decreases quality of the textures.

After the program closes, just re-pack the ytd with the contents from "output" folder which has been created.

If you use the unbuilt js file:
- Create a new folder and open it with VSCode.
- Open the terminal in VSCode and type: "npm install"
- After npm finishes, type: "node .", then follow the prompt.
- After the program closes, just re-pack the ytd with the contents from "output" folder which has been created.
